        <h2>The Forge of Legends</h2>
        <p>
          Gorvak Ironborn was born in the ash-choked valleys beneath the Molten Peaks, where rivers run with liquid ore and the wind carries the song of hammers.
          At age nine, he quenched his first blade in dragon’s breath; by sixteen, he reforged the shattered <em>Sword of Kings</em> after the War of Shattered Crowns.
        </p>
        <p>
          For fifty years, Gorvak has accepted only those who prove their worth—through trial, tale, or tear. He does not sell weapons. He bestows legacies.
          Every hammer strike is a vow. Every rune, a warning. And every weapon bears a soul: some benevolent, some vengeful, all unforgettable.
        </p>
        <p>
          His forge lies beyond the Ashen Pass—guarded by stone golems and silence. Few find it. Fewer leave unchanged.

              “He didn’t just make weapons—he made legacies. I stood before his forge with nothing but a broken oath and a scarred shield.
              He looked into my eyes, then into my past, and said, ‘You’re ready.’ Three wars later, Soulrend still sings when battle nears—and it remembers my name.”

              “I came to the Ashen Pass seeking power. Gorvak offered me something far heavier: consequence.
              Soulbrand doesn’t obey—it *chooses*. When I tried to cast a spell of domination, the staff went cold in my hands.
              But in the Siege of Black Hollow, when I stood alone against the Hollow King, it blazed like a fallen star.
              Gorvak didn’t give me a tool. He gave me a judge—and a guardian.”

              “After the Crown shattered, I lost everything—my king, my brother, my name. I wandered for years until I found the forge in the Molten Peaks.
              Gorvak said nothing. Just placed Soulward in my hands and walked away. That shield didn’t just stop arrows—it held back despair.
              When the Shadow Horde broke our lines at Dawn’s End, I stood. Not because I was strong, but because the shield remembered what I’d forgotten:
              that some things are worth holding, even when the world burns.”
